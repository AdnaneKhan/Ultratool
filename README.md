# Ultratool

Ultratool is a toy malicious program targeting Ubuntu Desktop 20.04. It was developed on my own time for a reverse engineering challenge held by Fortego, LLC (my employer)
during which a skilled reverse engineer took apart the program live.

This code is provided AS-IS. It was written to a level of quality appropriate to demonstrate a few techniques and should not be used for any other purpose.
